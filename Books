# One of my goals in 2022 is to deepen my understanding of different statitical models and machine learning algorithm and their appication in cancer research.
# To achieve this goal, I would like to devote my time on a few of books in the statistics, manchine learning, genomics and genetics field. 
# I will posted the books I am going to read here, and finished books with a mark for tracking my progress.

#1. Data Science from Scratch First Priciple of Python (I: May 2022, F: )
    # This book is recommended of a blog from R-blogger, which is a good start point for me to learn python and learn how to apply models and ML algorithm using Python.
#2. Deep Learning with R
#3. An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R
#4. Resources where I get the recommendations of books (https://towardsdatascience.com/5-great-data-science-books-for-lifelong-learners-3a6405a7f890)
