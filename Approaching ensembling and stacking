Ensembling is nothing but a combination of different models. The models can be combined by their predictions/probabilities. The simplest way to combine models would be just to do an average.
Ensemble Probabilities = (M1_proba + M2_proba + ... + Mn_Proba)/n
This is simple and yet the most effective way of combining models. In simple averaging, the weights are equal to all models. One thing you should keep in mind for any method of combining is that you
should always combine predictions/probabilities of models which are different from each other. In simple words, the combination of models which are not highly correlated works better than the combination of models
which are very correlated with each other.

Find the best weights of multiple models to optimize for AUC (or any kind of prediction-metric combination in general). 

Random Forest is an ensemble model. Random forest is just a combination of many simple decision trees. Random forest comes in a category of ensemble models which is popularly known as bagging. In bagging, we create small
subsets of data and train multiple simple models. The final result is obtained by a combination of predictions, such as average, of all such small models.

And the xgboost model that we used is also an ensemble model. All gradient boosting models are ensemble models and come under the umbrella name: boosting. Boosting models work similar to bagging models, except for the fact 
that consecutive models in boosting are trained on error residuals and tend to minimize the errors of preceding models. This way, boosting models can learn the data perfectly and are thus susceptible to overfitting.

Ensemble Modeling
Ensemble modeling is a machine learning technique where multiple models (often called "base models" or "weak learners") are trained and combined to solve the same problem. The main idea is that by combining several models, the ensemble can achieve better performance and generalization than any single model. There are several types of ensemble methods:

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): This involves training multiple models independently on different subsets of the data and then averaging their predictions (e.g., Random Forests).
Boosting: This involves training models sequentially, where each model tries to correct the errors of the previous one (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).
Voting: This involves training multiple models and then aggregating their predictions by taking a majority vote or averaging (e.g., hard voting, soft voting).
Stacking (Stacked Generalization)
Stacking is a specific type of ensemble technique that involves training multiple base models and then using their predictions as inputs to a higher-level model (often called a "meta-learner" or "stacker"). The meta-learner is trained to make the final prediction based on the outputs of the base models. The process generally involves:

Training Base Models: Train multiple base models on the training data.
Generating Predictions: Use the base models to make predictions on a validation set.
Training Meta-Learner: Use the predictions from the base models as features to train the meta-learner on the validation set.
Final Prediction: The meta-learner makes the final prediction based on the predictions of the base models.
Similarities
Combination of Models: Both ensemble modeling and stacking involve combining multiple models to improve performance.
Improved Performance: Both techniques aim to leverage the strengths of different models to achieve better generalization and accuracy.
Diversity: Both methods benefit from using diverse models to capture different aspects of the data.
Differences
Structure:

Ensemble Modeling: Combines the predictions of multiple models directly, often through averaging or voting.
Stacking: Uses a meta-learner to combine the predictions of base models, adding an additional layer of learning.
Training Process:

Ensemble Modeling: Base models are typically trained independently of each other.
Stacking: Base models are trained first, and then their predictions are used to train the meta-learner.
Complexity:

Ensemble Modeling: Generally simpler, as it involves combining predictions directly.
Stacking: More complex, as it requires an additional step of training a meta-learner on the predictions of base models.
Bias-Variance Tradeoff:

Ensemble Modeling: Techniques like bagging reduce variance by averaging multiple models, while boosting reduces bias by focusing on errors.
Stacking: Aims to reduce both bias and variance by learning how to best combine the base models' predictions.

Ensemble Modeling Examples and Use Cases
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

Example: Random Forest
How it works: Random Forest creates multiple decision trees using different subsets of the training data (generated through bootstrapping) and different subsets of features. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all the trees (for regression) or by majority voting (for classification).
Use Case: Random Forest is widely used in various domains such as finance for credit scoring, in healthcare for disease prediction, and in marketing for customer segmentation due to its robustness and ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality.
Boosting

Example: Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
How it works: GBM builds models sequentially, where each new model tries to correct the errors made by the previous models. The models are combined in a weighted manner to make the final prediction.
Use Case: GBM is commonly used in competitions like Kaggle for its high predictive accuracy. It’s also used in areas like risk management, fraud detection, and customer churn prediction.
Voting

Example: Voting Classifier
How it works: A voting classifier combines the predictions of multiple different models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, SVM) and makes the final prediction based on majority voting (hard voting) or averaging the probabilities (soft voting).
Use Case: Voting classifiers are useful when you have multiple models that perform well individually but have different strengths. They are often used in ensemble learning competitions and practical applications where robustness is crucial.
Stacking (Stacked Generalization) Example and Use Case
Stacking
Example: Stacked Ensemble
How it works:
Train Base Models: Train multiple base models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, SVM) on the training data.
Generate Predictions: Use the base models to make predictions on a validation set (or using cross-validation to avoid overfitting).
Train Meta-Learner: Use the predictions from the base models as features to train a meta-learner (e.g., another logistic regression, neural network) on the validation set.
Final Prediction: The meta-learner makes the final prediction based on the predictions of the base models.
Use Case: Stacking is often used in machine learning competitions (e.g., Kaggle) to achieve top performance. It’s also used in complex prediction tasks where combining different models’ strengths is beneficial, such as in healthcare for predicting patient outcomes, in finance for stock price prediction, and in marketing for personalized recommendations.
Example Workflow for Stacking
Let's consider a classification problem where we want to predict whether a customer will churn.

Train Base Models:

Train a logistic regression model.
Train a decision tree model.
Train a support vector machine (SVM) model.
Generate Predictions:

Use each of the base models to make predictions on a validation set.
Collect the predictions from each base model.
Train Meta-Learner:

Use the predictions from the logistic regression, decision tree, and SVM models as features.
Train a meta-learner, such as a neural network or another logistic regression model, on these features.
Final Prediction:

Use the meta-learner to make the final prediction based on the predictions of the base models.
Practical Considerations
Diversity of Base Models: The success of both ensemble modeling and stacking often depends on the diversity of the base models. Using models with different strengths and weaknesses can improve performance.
Overfitting: Care must be taken to avoid overfitting, especially in stacking where the meta-learner might overfit to the predictions of the base models. Cross-validation and careful selection of the meta-learner can help mitigate this risk.
Computational Resources: Both techniques can be computationally intensive, especially with a large number of base models or complex meta-learners. Efficient implementation and resource management are important.
